# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section2/exercises/methods.rb`

# Example: Write a method that when called will print your name:
def print_name
  p "Severus Snape"
end

print_name

# Write a method that takes a name as an argument and prints it:
def print_name(first_name, last_name)
  puts first_name + " " + last_name
end

print_name("Albus", "Dumbledore")

# Write a method that takes in 2 numbers as arguments and prints
# their sum. Then call your method three times with different arguments passed in:
# YOUR CODE HERE
def number (num1, num2)
  (num1 * num2)
end

puts number(2, 3)

num1 = 2
num2 = 4

puts number(num1, num2)

puts number(num1 - 1, num2 + 3)


# Write a method that takes in two strings as arguments and prints
# a concatenation of those two strings. Example: The arguments could be
# (man, woman) and the end result might output: "When Harry Met Sally".
# Then call your method three times with different arguments passed in.

def colors(color1, color2)
  puts color1 + " and " + color2
end

colors("white", "black")

# PART 3: Naming is Hard
#-------------------


# Naming is notoriously hard in programming. It is a skill to name a variable or function concisely enough that it is reasonable to type, but descriptive enough that others can infer the meaning.

# Look at the code you wrote for the previous YOU DOðŸŽˆ - what did you name the function, and why?
# What did you name each parameter, and why?

# EXPLAIN: I named the function colors becuase I was combining two strings that were colors. The parameters were color1 and color2 becuase I was passing through only two colors.
