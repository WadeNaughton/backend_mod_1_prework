## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

  The SuperLearner article was a good read to further instill methods to learning that were taught throughout Mod 0. I would say that taking breaks, early and often is something that is already built into my learning methods. I prefer to take some time to reflect on what was just taught, and then revisit the material after a short break. I definitely need to take more stock on what I am eating and how to better introduce 'brain foods' into my normal diet. Taking time to sit down and think about what to buy at the grocery store ahead of time will help in this area. The only thing I would add to this article is that there should be a section on making sure that one is taking care of their body, as well as their mind. A good exercise regiment is also good for the mind.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

    prints "Hello World!"

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

    A # is used.

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

    An integer is any whole number, while a float is any number with a floating decimal point. Both are whole numbers, but an integer cannot contain a decimal point.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

      puts animal = "zebra"

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

    puts animal

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

    Interpolations is substitution of defined variables or expressions in a given String with respected values.

    puts "My favorite animal to see at the zoo is a #{animal}."

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

    gets is the method used to get input from a user.

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
    -concatenation is a string method. This is the method of combining multiple strings into one string. It is used with the + symbol.
    -Interpolation is another string method. This is similar to concatenation, but this is more of building a template, and filling in the gaps with variables that we have assigned values to.
