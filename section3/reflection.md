## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  - This was early in the first blog post, but the S.M.A.R.T acronym really stuck with me. I had previously worked with similar type methods, but I feel that this one lays out all that is needed to be successful. For me, The 'T' in the acronym is really what I should strive to improve on. Having a time-bound goal helps me stay on track and make sure that the work is completed. Open ended goals can stall as time passes and pressure is not applied to get the work completed.  
  - The second point that I resonated with was the practice, practice, practice section. This is obvious to many people, but it is something I need to focus on. I am coming from a job where I did not need to engage after I was done for the day. There was no need for practice, so my practice skills worsened. This coding boot camp will require lots of practice and it will be something that I need to train my brain to get used to again.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

- I currently demonstrate a growth mindset by seeking out new challenges. I do not want to rest on what I already know, but would rather continue to learn and grow as a person. I do struggle in reaching out for help though. I sometimes do not want to come across as someone who does not know an answer, but in reality, asking for help is a clear sign that someone wants to learn and is taking the steps to make sure that is done.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

- A hash is a way to store data just like a list, but instead of using only numbers to get the data, you can use almost anything.

- The difference between the two is that arrays let you use numbers to find out whats in the array, but a hash lets you use anything as an index.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```
pet_store = {
  "number_of_pets" => 25,
  "bags_of_food" => 100,
  "number_of_cages" => 40,
  "number_of_toys" => 50
}
```
1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

- `puts states["IA"]`

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

- `puts states.keys`
- `puts states.values`

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

- An example of when to use a hash would be when we need to look things up in a big collection of data. We would not need to loop through the other elements to search for something as we would in an array.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
