## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

- I was able to retain more information this week while using the Pomodoro flow. This allowed for my brain to take a little break and think of something that wasn't on a screen. In my experience, too much screen time can cause a lot of things to look or sound similar.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

1. In your own words, what is a Class?

- basic building block in OOP and they help to define a blueprint for creating objects.

1. What is an attribute of a Class?

- An attribute of a class is a named property that describes a range of values. For example, age and name would be attributes.

1. What is behavior of a Class?

- The behavior of a class are the methods that an object performs. It is the operation being performed.

1. In the space below, create a Dog class with at least 2 attributes and 2 behaviors:

```
class Dog
    attr_reader :name, :age
    def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  def new_name(new_name)
    @name = new_name
  end

  def getting_older(new_age)
    @age = new_age
  end
end

```

1. How do you create an instance of a class?
- You create an object.
1. What questions do you still have about classes in Ruby?
- I have many that I would like to ask in person. This was a very difficult section and seemed too much to learn without a teacher.
